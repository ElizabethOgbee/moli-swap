# MoliSwap
This is a repository for moli swap

## How it Works
To use MoliSwap, all you need to do is connect your STACKS compartible wallet to the dapp and go to the navigate to the section of your interesst.
### Provide Liquidity
On MoliSwap, you can be a Liquidity provider, which would need you to move to the Admin page to provide the liquidity pair of your interest.
for a start, we are testing with STX/moli amd STX/lima. Both $moli and $lima tokens are our locally created tokens for the sole purpose of testing, however,
we can use the $moli as our utility token when things get more sserious.
### Make a swap
There is a Swap page, you can just go their and select the coin you want to swap from the dropdown of coins in our pool, enter the amount you want to swap and select the coin you 
want to swap to, you would get the summary of the coin you would get and other needful details


## Getting started](#get-started)
To get started, you would ojust need to go to the website https://www.. and connect your wallet, the UI is very intuitive.
To add Liquidity, just navigate to Admin page and add liquidity using your prefered pair, you would get some moli-lp tokens at successful adding of 
the liquidity and that would be redeemable to your initial investment and your accrued interest, you again more if your liquidity stays longet in the 
pool
To swap, you just head over to the Swap page and select your prefered coin to swap and the one to swap into, note that you do not need to have 
STX in your wallet to perform your swap, we would charge you in the coin you are swaping and do your swap for you.
